# üêç Mobile Snake Game ‚Äì LLD with SOLID, Design Patterns, and Distributed Readiness

This project implements a modular, extensible Snake game in Python using object-oriented principles, SOLID design, and architectural patterns fit for scaling to multiplayer or distributed environments.

## üß± Core Components

1. **SnakeGameEngine** ‚Äì Controls the game loop and state transitions.
2. **Board** ‚Äì Represents the 2D game grid with wrapping.
3. **Snake** ‚Äì Maintains the snake‚Äôs position, growth, and movement logic.
4. **FoodSpawner** ‚Äì Uses a strategy to place food on the board.
5. **InputHandler** ‚Äì Handles user or remote input via callbacks.
6. **GameLogger** ‚Äì Singleton logger for tracking game events.
7. **Renderer** ‚Äì Renders game state to console.
8. **GameServerInterface** ‚Äì Interface to abstract multiplayer or online play.

## üß© Design Patterns Used

| Pattern               | Purpose                                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Strategy**          | For flexible food spawning logic.                            |
| **Observer**          | `InputHandler` notifies the engine of direction changes.     |
| **Command**           | Directional input can be treated as commands.                |
| **Singleton**         | Central logger via `GameLogger`.                             |
| **Factory-like**      | `FoodSpawner` creates food objects with a swappable strategy.|
| **MVC (lightweight)** | Separation of concerns between UI rendering and game logic.  |

## ‚úÖ SOLID Principles

- **S**ingle Responsibility: Entities have isolated roles (e.g. rendering vs logic).
- **O**pen/Closed: Easily extend `FoodStrategy`, `Renderer`, or add power-ups.
- **L**iskov: Subtypes like `IFoodStrategy` can be replaced seamlessly.
- **I**nterface Segregation: Input, rendering, and networking are cleanly separated.
- **D**ependency Inversion: Game engine relies on abstract interfaces (e.g. `GameServerInterface`).

## üîÅ Scalability & Extensibility

- **Multiplayer Ready**: Use `GameServerInterface` to plug into WebSocket or cloud sync.
- **Theming**: UI rendering logic is decoupled and swappable.
- **Analytics**: Extend `GameLogger` to support remote log streaming.
- **Cloud Save**: Add `GameStateSerializer` for persistence and replays.
