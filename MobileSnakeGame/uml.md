Here's a **Low-Level Design (LLD)** for a **Mobile Snake Game**, crafted using **SOLID principles**, **relevant design patterns**, and scalable/extensible architecture considerations. We'll also include a **UML class diagram** and key explanations for decisions relevant to **distributed environments** (e.g., multiplayer, analytics, logging, etc.).

### üß± Core Components (Entities)

1. **SnakeGameEngine** ‚Äì Controls game loop, state transitions.
2. **Board** ‚Äì Represents the 2D grid.
3. **Snake** ‚Äì Maintains snake‚Äôs body positions and direction.
4. **FoodSpawner** ‚Äì Handles food placement.
5. **InputHandler** ‚Äì Handles user input.
6. **GameState** ‚Äì Holds game state data (score, snake, board, etc.).
7. **Renderer** ‚Äì Renders game state to UI.
8. **GameServerInterface** ‚Äì For distributed or online game modes (optional).
9. **GameLogger** ‚Äì For analytics/log storage (scalable and extensible).

### üß© Design Patterns Used

| Pattern               | Usage                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strategy**          | To change game modes (e.g. Easy, Hard) or food spawning logic |
| **Observer**          | InputHandler notifies GameEngine of changes                   |
| **Command**           | Handle button press commands (e.g. swipe directions)          |
| **Singleton**         | For centralized Logger or Config                              |
| **Factory**           | For creating game objects like Snake, Board, Food             |
| **MVC** (lightweight) | Decouple UI rendering from core logic                         |

### ‚úÖ Applying SOLID Principles

* **S**ingle Responsibility: `Renderer`, `Snake`, `Board`, and `InputHandler` are separated.
* **O**pen-Closed: Adding new game elements or food types via interfaces.
* **L**iskov: `Tile`, `Food`, etc. implement proper substitutable behaviors.
* **I**nterface Segregation: `ISnakeMovement`, `IGameLogger`, etc.
* **D**ependency Inversion: `GameEngine` depends on interfaces, not implementations (for testing/mockability).

---

### üß© Composition, Aggregation, and Association

* **Composition**:

  * `SnakeGameEngine` **owns** and manages lifecycle of `Board`, `Snake`, `Renderer`, `FoodSpawner`, etc.
  * `Snake` contains a `Deque` of positions (body) ‚Äî tight coupling as part of its lifecycle.
* **Aggregation**:

  * `SnakeGameEngine` interacts with `InputHandler`, which may be created outside and passed in (loose binding).
* **Association**:

  * `Renderer` is associated with `Board` and `Snake` but doesn't manage their lifecycles ‚Äî interacts for rendering.
  * `GameServerInterface` is associated optionally ‚Äî pluggable for distributed environment support.

---

### üîÅ Scalability & Extensibility

* **Multiplayer/Online** mode: Introduce `GameServerInterface` (stubbed in mobile; active in distributed env).
* **Analytics**: Plug-in `GameLogger` or `EventPublisher` using event queues or REST endpoints.
* **Skin Packs / Themes**: Use composition in `Renderer`.
* **Cloud Sync**: Use `GameStateSerializer` and backend sync.

### üåê Distributed Environment Considerations

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multiplayer Sync** | Abstract via `GameServerInterface` for different backends (Firebase, custom server, etc.) |
| **Event Logging**    | `GameLogger` with batch API push or event queue                                           |
| **Leaderboards**     | Abstracted in a `LeaderboardService` which can be swapped with offline stub               |
| **Offline Support**  | `GameStateSerializer` to save/load from local storage                                     |
| **Cloud Save**       | Pluggable backend for syncing `GameState`                                                 |

### üß™ Extending Further

* Add `PowerUpTile` implementing `Tile`
* Support `ThemeManager` for UI
* Add `RewindFeature` with Memento pattern
* Implement AI for snake with `SnakeBot` extending `Snake`
