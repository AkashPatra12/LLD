## 📘 System Design & Extensibility Overview (Single-Threaded Snake Game)

---

### ✅ What Has Been Considered in the Single-Threaded Snake Game

#### ✅ Design Considerations:

* **SOLID Principles**: Each class has a single responsibility, and interfaces abstract behaviors (e.g., `IFoodStrategy`).
* **Design Patterns**: Strategy, Factory, Singleton, and Observer are applied for clean separation of concerns.
* **Modularity**: Components like `Snake`, `Board`, `Renderer`, `FoodSpawner` can be reused or swapped.
* **Simplicity**: No concurrency or I/O complexity.
* **Testability**: Pure functions and separation allow for easy unit testing.

### ❌ Disadvantages of This Approach

| Limitation                   | Reason                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ No real-time control       | No `tick_rate` or delay—ticks run as fast as CPU allows        |
| ❌ Single-player only         | No multiplayer or server-client architecture                   |
| ❌ No I/O or persistence      | Game state isn’t saved, logged externally, or fetched remotely |
| ❌ Doesn’t scale horizontally | Can’t serve multiple game instances or users concurrently      |
| ❌ Blocking execution         | One game loop per process, not optimized for parallel sessions |

### 🔄 Is the Code Extensible?

#### ✅ Yes, because:

* **Strategy Pattern**: New food placement algorithms (e.g., clustered, timed) can be added easily.
* **InputHandler** decouples input from core logic; can be replaced with keyboard, API, or WebSocket input.
* **Renderer** can be swapped for GUI or web rendering with no core logic changes.
* **GameEngine** controls state; multiplayer or scoring modules can be plugged in using interfaces.
* **Logger** is a singleton and can be extended to push logs to files or monitoring tools.

### 🚀 How to Deploy for High Scalability (e.g., 1000 RPS)

#### 1. Convert Architecture from Monolithic to Distributed

* Host game state and engine per user session or room.
* Store global state (e.g., leaderboard, analytics) in distributed stores.

#### 2. Backend Service Design

* Use microservices:

  * `SessionService`: Manages game sessions
  * `GameEngineService`: Processes moves per tick
  * `LeaderboardService`: Stores scores, rankings
  * `EventLogger`: Sends logs asynchronously

#### 3. Stateless APIs

* Use REST or WebSocket APIs for:

  * Directional input
  * Fetching current board state
  * Streaming events
* Use Load Balancer to route requests based on session ID.

#### 4. Traffic Handling

* Deploy behind API Gateway + Load Balancers (e.g., AWS ALB, NGINX).
* Use **horizontal scaling** (e.g., Kubernetes, ECS).
* Use **Redis** for fast access to recent game state.
* Use **Kafka/SQS** for async event pipelines and logging.

### 🔐 Breaking Change Management

#### ✅ Principles:

* **Versioned APIs**: e.g., `/v1/move`, `/v2/start`
* **Feature flags**: Gradually roll out new features to controlled users
* **Schema evolution**: Always use additive changes (avoid breaking existing fields)

#### 💡 Example:

If you add a `PowerUp` feature:

* Add `powerUp` field as optional in `GameState`
* Ensure old clients simply ignore unknown fields
* Use feature flag to enable the new feature for a few users first

### ✅ Summary

| Aspect           | Status / Suggestion                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Extensible Code  | ✅ Yes, due to use of patterns, separation of concerns        |
| Disadvantages    | ❌ Not real-time, ❌ not multiplayer, ❌ not concurrent         |
| Scalable Design  | Move to microservices + stateless APIs + load balancing      |
| Traffic Handling | API Gateway + LB + auto-scaling + Redis + event queues       |
| Breaking Changes | Versioned APIs + Feature flags + optional fields in payloads |
